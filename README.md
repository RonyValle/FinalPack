# FinalPack

## Introduction


***

This is the README file for my FinalPack here you will find a description of what I learned in each week for
my Networking 3 Linux class as well as the link to that repository here in Github where they are hosted.
Each week we completed a shell script. The book that we read for this class was Brian Ward's
"How Linux Works". The assignments will be inside each repository. Click in each weeks repository to see the contents of that 
particular week.

## Week2

In week 2 we read chapter 2 which is titled "Basic Commands and Directory Hierarchy". This chapter is one of the most important 
chapters in my opinion because it gave me the knowledge to navigate around in my Linux system. I learned the most basic 
commands in this chapter including:
* `ls` To list the contents of a directoy.
* `cd` To change to a different directory in my file system.
* `echo` To print something to the screen or send its output to a file.
* `cat` To output the contents of a file.
* `cp` to copy a file
* `mv` To move or rename a file. 
* *(Take a look at my week2 repository to see all the commands that I learned. The shell script in that repository has all of them)*

## Week3


In week 3 we read chapter 3 titled "Devices" In this chapter I learned about the /dev/null directory. Evrything that gets sent
to this directory will be discarted by the kernel. I also learn about the dd utility and about its different uses. I used this utility when I created my bootable USB drive. Find that documantation here:
